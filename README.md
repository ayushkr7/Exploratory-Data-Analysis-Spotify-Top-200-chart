## Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Spotify-Top-200-chart
The repository contains my EDA submission for Jovian's <b>Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas</b> course.
<br>

The dataset I have used for EDA contains the Top 200 Weekly (Global) charts of Spotify in 2020 & 2021. 
The chart is made by Spotify and is updated regularly, so our dataset doesn't include just 200 songs but 
1556 songs that made it to Top 200 charts during 2020-21 even if it was just for a single day.
